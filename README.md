# RecommendedReading

The Recommended Reading CLI scrapes lists of top selling or recommended books from various sources such as the New York Times, Barnes and Noble, and Publishers Weekly, and then allows the user to view information about and reviews of those books from goodreads.com.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'recommended_reading'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install recommended_reading

## Usage

enter `bin/recommended-reading` and follow the prompts.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
